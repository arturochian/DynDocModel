Formalized remote alternative Elements (RemoteAlternateImpl or AlternateImplRef class)

	   This would be when we are offering an additional alternative to or retrieving an additional element from an external document

Also, formalized remote "Extension"/"FurtherDiscussion" Element classes
	   This would be a formal mechanism for saying that a thread/element/document is an extension or further discussion of (Some or all) content in another external document

	   In particular this would allow teacher to do the type of annotations, etc Duncan and Deb have talked about without needing to own the document.

	   Furthermore, it could be useful to look at/compare different extensions of the same document.

These types of things will require a way to specify a way of selecting/pointing at elements/subdocuments within our Dynamic Documents (xpath/xpointer analogue)
      Implementation detail: I think having the more general conceptual model is useful, but we could still be storing these documents internally as XML. That gives us xpath/xpointer for free.
