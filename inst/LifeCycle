Content and Code authoring
	Adding structure
       	       Grouping things in tasks, specifying alternatives
	       This can be done by hand, via gui (someday), or by programatically manipulating existing linear documents
	Linking to pieces of other documents

Describe/Display structure of the document
		 Useful for navigation in interactive settings, and for specifying projections

Projection
	Select portion of the document to be viewed. Particular threads (paths through the document) might be displayed while the rest is suppressed (though still present).
	This means we need a way of querying documents and specifying subdocuments. Based on structure, metadata, or both
	     see Querying.txt for discussion
	     

Create output view from Projection
       Run code, insert results, render into viewable document
       eg knit, sweave, xDynDoc functions

View document view
     static a la pdf/html generated by sweave/knitr/xDynDoc
     interactive a la ipython notebook, IDynDocs, RFirefox Web pages
